# Day 03 â€“ Data Types ðŸ”¢

Welcome to Day 03 of your Python journey!

## ðŸ“š Theory â€“ Data Types in Python

In Python, every piece of data has a **type**. The most common types are:

- `str` â€“ String (text), e.g., `"hello"`
- `int` â€“ Integer (whole number), e.g., `7`
- `float` â€“ Decimal number, e.g., `3.14`
- `bool` â€“ Boolean (True or False)

You can check a variable's type using the `type()` function:

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
```

## ðŸ§  What to do:

# Task: Practice working with different data types

# Step 1: Create a variable for each of the following:
# - your name (as a string)
# - your age (as an integer)
# - your height (as a float)
# - whether you're a student (as a boolean)

# Step 2: Print each variable and its type
