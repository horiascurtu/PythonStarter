# 🧪 Project Setup Instructions: Python 30-Day Learning Pack

Welcome to the **Python Developer Starter Kit**! Before you run any code from this project, follow these simple steps to safely use a **virtual environment**.

---

## 🔧 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Open your terminal in the root of this project, then run:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

---

## ▶️ 2. Activate the Environment

### On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, your prompt should change to show `(venv)`.

---

## 📦 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If you're working on one of the 30-day exercises, you may not need any packages.
> For the final project or API/web scraping days, dependencies like `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, etc., will be required.

---

## ✅ 4. Run Any File You Like

```bash
python main.py
```
or

```bash
python exercitii.py
```

---

## 🧼 Optional Cleanup

To deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

Happy coding! 🐍🚀
