# Day 09 â€“ Dictionaries ðŸ“–

Welcome to Day 09 of your Python journey!

## ðŸ“š Theory â€“ Dictionaries

A **dictionary** stores data in key-value pairs.

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(person["name"])  # prints "Alice"
```

You can:
- Access: `dict[key]`
- Add: `dict["new_key"] = value`
- Loop: `for key in dict:`

## ðŸ§  What to do:

# Task: Create a dictionary with info about you:
# - name
# - age
# - city

# Then:
# - Print each key and value
# - Add a new key: "hobby"

You're doing great â€” keep going! ðŸš€
