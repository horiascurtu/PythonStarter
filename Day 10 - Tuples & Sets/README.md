# Day 10 â€“ Tuples & Sets ðŸ“¦

Welcome to Day 10 of your Python journey!

## ðŸ“š Theory â€“ Tuples and Sets

### Tuples:
- Like lists, but **immutable** (can't be changed)

```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
```

### Sets:
- Unordered collection with **unique** items

```python
nums = {1, 2, 2, 3}
print(nums)  # {1, 2, 3}
```

## ðŸ§  What to do:

# Task:

# 1. Create a tuple of your top 3 favorite colors
# 2. Create a set of 5 numbers with some duplicates
# 3. Print both collections
