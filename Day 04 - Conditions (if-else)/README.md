# Day 04 – Conditions (if-else) 🔁

Welcome to Day 04 of your Python journey!

## 📚 Theory – if / else in Python

`if` statements let you run code **only when a condition is true**.

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You're an adult")
else:
    print("You're a minor")
```

Use **indentation** (tabs or spaces) to define what happens inside each condition.

## 🧠 What to do:

# Task: Ask for user's age and print a message

# If age is 18 or above, print "You can vote!"
# Otherwise, print "You are too young to vote."

# Use input(), convert it to int, and write the if-else logic
