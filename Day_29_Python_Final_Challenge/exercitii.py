# Day 29 - CLI To-Do Project

# Your task is to implement a CLI-based to-do manager.

# Basic functionality:
# - add a task
# - show tasks
# - remove task
# - mark task as done

# You should use argparse and json to save/load data.

# Start by implementing the following:
# 1. argparse with "command" (add/show/remove/done)
# 2. a file "tasks.json" to store task data
# 3. define functions: load_tasks, save_tasks, add_task, show_tasks, remove_task, mark_done
