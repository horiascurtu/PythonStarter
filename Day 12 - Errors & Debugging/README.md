# Day 12 – Errors & Debugging 🐞

Welcome to Day 12 of your Python journey!

## 📚 Theory – Errors & Debugging

### Types of errors:
- **SyntaxError**: you typed something Python doesn't understand
- **NameError**: you used a variable that doesn't exist
- **TypeError**: you tried to mix incompatible types

Use `try`/`except` to handle errors:

```python
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid number.")
```

## 🧠 What to do:

# Task: Ask user to enter a number

# Use try/except to catch invalid input
# Print "You entered: X" if valid
# Print "Invalid input!" if not
