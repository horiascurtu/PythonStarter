# 🔢 Day 2: Variables and Data Types

Today you'll dive into one of the most fundamental concepts in programming: **variables**. You'll also learn about Python's **basic data types** and how to use them to store and manipulate information.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- What variables are and how to use them
- Naming rules and best practices
- Basic data types in Python: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- Type checking and conversion

## ✍️ Variables in Python

A variable is like a container for storing a value.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
is_student = True
```

You can access and print variables like this:

```python
print(name)
print(age)
```

## 🧪 Basic Data Types

| Type    | Example         |
|---------|-----------------|
| Integer (`int`) | `42`, `-7`, `0` |
| Float (`float`) | `3.14`, `-0.001` |
| String (`str`) | `"Hello"`, `'Python'` |
| Boolean (`bool`) | `True`, `False` |

---

## 🔄 Type Checking and Conversion

Use `type()` to check a variable’s type:

```python
x = 10
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
```

Convert between types:

```python
str_num = "42"
num = int(str_num)  # converts string to integer
```
