# 🎉 Day 30: Final Challenge & Wrap-Up

Congratulations on reaching **Day 30** of your Python learning journey! 🏁

Today is all about **putting everything together** in a final challenge and reflecting on how far you’ve come. This is your chance to **apply core concepts** from the past 29 days to build something meaningful.

---

## 🧠 What You’ve Learned

Over 30 days, you’ve built a solid foundation in:
- Variables, data types, loops, conditionals
- Functions, lists, dictionaries, sets
- File handling, error handling, and debugging
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Modules, JSON, CLI apps, APIs, virtual environments
- Testing, web scraping, and more!

## 🎯 Final Challenge: Python Portfolio Project

**Build a project using the tools you’ve learned.**

Here are 3 ideas to choose from (or make your own!):

### ✅ Option 1: Contact Manager
- Add, edit, delete, and list contacts
- Store data in a JSON file
- CLI interface with `argparse`

### 🗓 Option 2: Event Countdown App
- User inputs future events (name + date)
- Display remaining time until each event
- Save/load data from file

### 🌍 Option 3: Weather App (API-based)
- Input a city name
- Fetch current weather from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
- Display temperature and condition

---

## 📦 Requirements
Your project should:
- Use functions and modular code
- Accept user input (via CLI or script)
- Handle errors gracefully
- Include basic documentation (README or comments)

---

## 🚀 Share Your Work

- Save your code in a folder named `final_project`
- Optionally push to GitHub
- Keep improving it over time!

---

## 🏁 You Made It!

Whether you’re continuing to more advanced topics or building your own apps — remember:
