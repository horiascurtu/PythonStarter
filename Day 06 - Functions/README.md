# Day 06 – Functions 🧩

Welcome to Day 06 of your Python journey!

## 📚 Theory – Functions in Python

A **function** is a block of reusable code.

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)
```

To use (or “call”) the function:
```python
greet("Ana")
```

## 🧠 What to do:

# Task: Create a function that takes a name and prints a greeting

# Example: greet("Maria") → prints "Hello, Maria!"
