## ðŸ“š Theory â€“ Reading & Writing Files

Python lets you read/write files using `open()`:

```python
# Writing
with open("notes.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello!")

# Reading
with open("notes.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
```

## ðŸ§  What to do:

# Task: Create a file and write a message

# Then read the message and print it
