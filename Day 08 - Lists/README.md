# Day 08 â€“ Lists ðŸ“‹

Welcome to Day 08 of your Python journey!

## ðŸ“š Theory â€“ Lists

A **list** is a collection of items in a specific order.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # prints "apple"
```

You can:
- Add with `.append()`
- Remove with `.remove()`
- Loop through with `for`

## ðŸ§  What to do:

# Task: Create a list of your 3 favorite movies

# Then:
# - Add one more using append()
# - Remove one using remove()
# - Print each movie using a loop
