# Day 05 – Loops (for, while) 🔁

Welcome to Day 05 of your Python journey!

## 📚 Theory – Loops

### for loop:
Repeat something a set number of times.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello", i)
```

### while loop:
Repeat as long as a condition is true.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## 🧠 What to do:

# Task: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using both loops

# First using a for loop
# Then using a while loop
