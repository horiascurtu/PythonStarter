# Day 01 â€“ Hello Python ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Day 1 of your Python journey!

Today, you'll write and run your very first Python script.  
Donâ€™t worry â€” it's simple, and weâ€™ll walk you through every step.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What you'll learn:
- What a Python script is
- How to write and run one
- What the `print()` function does

---

## ðŸ§  What to do:

1. Open the file `hello.py` from this folder.
2. On the blank line, type the following exactly:

```python
print("Hello, Python world!")
```

3. Save the file.
4. Run the file using your code editor or terminal:
   - In **Thonny** or **VS Code**, just click the "Run" button or press `F5`.

---

## âœ… What should happen:

You should see this message displayed on the screen:

```
Hello, Python world!
```

---

## ðŸ§µ What does the code mean?

```python
print("Hello, Python world!")
```

- `print()` is a **function** that tells Python to show something on the screen.
- The text inside the **quotes** is called a **string** â€” itâ€™s just plain text.
- Python will display whatever you write inside the parentheses and quotes.

This is your first step as a developer!

---

ðŸ“Œ **Tip:** Always make sure your quotes `"` and parentheses `()` are typed exactly as shown.

Letâ€™s go! ðŸš€
