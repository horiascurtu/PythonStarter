# Day 02 – Variables and Input 🧠

Welcome to Day 2 of your Python journey!

Today, you’ll learn how to:
- Store information using **variables**
- Ask the user for input using the `input()` function
- Combine variables and `print()` to create interactive programs

---

## 📚 Theory – What is a variable?

A **variable** is like a container for storing information.  
You give it a name, and it keeps track of a value.

### Example:
```python
name = "Alex"
```

Now the variable `name` stores the value `"Alex"`.  
You can use it later in your program like this:

```python
print("Hello, " + name)
```

This will display:

```
Hello, Alex
```

---

## 📚 Theory – What is `input()`?

The `input()` function asks the user for some information.  
Whatever the user types is stored as a **string**.

### Example:
```python
age = input("How old are you? ")
print("You are " + age + " years old.")
```

## 🧠 What to do:

### ✏️ Option 1: Run it online

Use this site: [https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)

### 💻 Option 2: Run in Thonny

Open the file `variables_input.py`, and write code that:

1. Asks the user for their name  
2. Stores it in a variable  
3. Prints a greeting like: `Hello, Ana!`

---

## ✅ Bonus task:

Ask the user for their favorite color and print a message like:  
`Nice! Blue is a great color.`

You're now making your programs interactive — and that’s powerful.  
Let’s go! 🚀
